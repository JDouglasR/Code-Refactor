    New Elements: ```<header>``` - Contains Company name and navigation tag. <br>
                  ```<nav>``` - Contains navigation links for the page. <br>
                  ```<figure>``` - Contains main image for the page, and related attributes. <br>
                  ```<main>``` - Wrapper for the main section on the page. <br>
                  ```<section>``` - Utilized to separate the different strategies provided by the Company. <br>
                  ```<aside>``` - Utilized as a wrapper to separate side-bar from the main section. <br>
                  ```<footer>``` - Contains Company name and copyright information. <br>
